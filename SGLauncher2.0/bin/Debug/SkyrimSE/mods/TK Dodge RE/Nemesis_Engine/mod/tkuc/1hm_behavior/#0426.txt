<!-- This removes Ultimate combat's bow pitch replacement with the vanilla one, while also adding on the Modifier List That We disable in #tkuc$107.txt -->
<!-- Even though the Modifier list we re add does nothing it needs to be here as Nemesis doesn't like duplicate to original files -->
<!-- by including the modifier list that's disabled Nemesis sees this edit and does it's thing correctly -->
<!-- We can't delete other people's edits or make them empty files so this is next best thing -->
<!-- TK Dodge Re Version reassigned the edited node to the correct ID, TK dodge RE moves all of regular OG TK dodge nodes around -->
