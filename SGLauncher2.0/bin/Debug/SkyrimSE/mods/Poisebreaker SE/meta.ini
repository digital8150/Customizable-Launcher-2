In actual game balance it can be somewhat arbitrary: high level enemies might have low poise because of their armor value, and lowlevel players might already have high poise because they don heavy armor. In Dark Souls, weight is an actual mechanic; poise is affected by player stat and enemies have hardcoded poise values. So we need to make further calculations to influence poise with respect to the game systems.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599][b]The limitations[/b]:[/color] the vanilla game systems are somewhat incoherent, making it hard to calculate Poise universally. This is inherent to the open nature of Skyrim.\xa0 Suppose that we have an enemy mob type of say, a \"Bandit Stabman\x201d. In another game, every bandit stabman mob can be treated the same.. In Skyrim however, each \x201c\x42\x61ndit Stabman\x201d instance is expected to be unique. The openness of Skyrim's makes its rpg systems very messy and not pliable for poise scaling - we cannot scale NPCs by their SkillAVs because vanilla doesnt have any coherent rule for NPC skill AVs.\xa0\n<br />I decided to scale Poise withActor Level - in my opinion it is the best enemy scaling factor because it is universal: across modded games, enemy stats and leveled lists can diverge widely, but an enemy's level will always reflect how strong they should be in relation to the player.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6b6b6][i][size=3]Poisebreaker[/size]\xa0[/i][/color][/b]is a rebalance and partial rework of Loki\x2019s Poise mod to better integrate into the rest of Skyrim. This mod is intended for players using modern ARPG combat frameworks such as MCO: in conjunction with such mods, the Poise system serves as a punishment for missing attacks.\xa0Poisebreaker respects Skyrim's RPG systems and creates meaningful character decisions:\n<br />\n<br />Heavy Armor increases[color=#f4cccc] [b]Max Poise[/b][/color] and enables players to tank heavy hits.\n<br />Light Armor grants significantly less Poise, but compensates with [color=#9fc5e8][b]Hyperarmor[/b][/color]. LightArmor players can play aggressively, utilizing [color=#9fc5e8][b]Hyperarmor[/b] [/color]to attack without staggering.\n<br />Magic users are disadvantaged in the Poise system but they can level the playing field with flesh spells and wards that reduce stagger, as well as utilizing spell poise to engage at distance.\n<br />Perks in various trees can be unlocked to improve the player's Poise or to unlock additional sources of stagger damage.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6][size=2][b]The default ini in Poisebreaker\xa0is provisional, and intended and balanced for use with a dodge mod and a stamina mod adding stamina cost to light attacks. In the absence of such mods, you might want to reduce poise damage by changing the global poise multipliers in the INI in order to prevent excessive staggerlocking.[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599][size=5][b]Poise DLL Formula Changes[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />-NPC and player poise/hyperarmor math have been separated across the board as the core tenet of balance. Poise mechanics scale with certain player systems. Poise\x2019s Keyword system has been given additive keywords alongside the multiplicative ones.\n<br />\n<br />In Poisebreaker, [color=#f4cccc][b]Poise[/b][/color] passively scales with actor level, since it is a stat comparable to hp/sp/mp. Half of the player\x2019s poise comes from build choice (weight of armor and skill) while the other half comes from natural progression. Direct level scaling means that the [color=#f4cccc][b]Poise[/b] [/color]system fully respects the vanilla game\x2019s leveling system: high level enemies will have higher [color=#f4cccc][b]Poise[/b] [/color]values than the player, leading to harder encounters. Level scaling stops at level 100 and level 60 for NPCs and the player respectively. Actor Level is in my opinion the best enemy scaling factor because it is universal: across modded games enemy stats and leveled lists can vary widely, but an enemy's level will always reflect how strong they should be in relation to the player. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4cccc][b]NPC Poise[/b][/color] scales with AR logarithmically to reflect better poise values in well-equipped NPCs.\xa0\n<br />[color=#f4cccc][b]Player Poise[/b][/color] also scales with armor rating but at a much lower rate: the player is rewarded for accumulating as much AR as they can, but it is not the primary factor for changing Poise breakpoints. Wearing heavy armor, taking up Poise Perks, or simply leveling up has the most significant increase on the player's Max Poise. The AR scaling is logarithmic - this means diminishing returns. Higher values of AR gives less and less Poise Health.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />In Poisebreaker, a portion of health damage taken (default 10%) is absorbed as poise damage. Power attacks will stagger more, since they do vastly more HP dmg than light attacks.\n<br />\n<br />As Poise Damage scales with DPS, the player can expect to improve their [color=#f4cccc][b]Poise damage[/b][/color] by simply upgrading their DPS normally. They can also pick up perk points that grant additional sources of Poise damage. But heed caution: stronger NPCs will also do more Poise damage!\n<br />\n<br />[b][img width=207,height=207]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5-Qgao6x7aoobC5Smg-bYWK9KBW-9vnYVfJ0rjfKGQ5GguQH8nAWKvLIj_xnYGcmlak3UKC0WUaV4MD0VjJ3zuyq88bxQ6hMlxc5kEAiCzkrOaezuNlD-XJ81NcS4HtRQoA8MrsDnwiSFkW5YXaQQvc[/img][/b]\n<br />[color=#cccccc][i]Default leveling curve for Max Poise where x=ArmorRating: this is the graph for how Poise scales with ArmorRating when base poise is constant.\xa0\n<br />Base poise = EquipWeight + 1/2 Actor Level + 0.2kHeavyArmor.\xa0\n<br />Black is for NPCs, Red is for players.

Leveling light armor improves dexterity and balance, allowing the player to attack and cast spells without being staggered.

Both the player and NPCs are affected by spell poise. Spell poise damage is 25% of base magic effect magnitude by default, while poise damage from concentration spells is 6.25% of base magnitude. Concentration spells have unique stagger logic: they only stagger once when meter is depleted and not at the other thresholds, which means one stagger per poise meter. This is to prevent comical staggerlock. Concentrations spells of low magnitude wont do any poise damage (happens because of integer truncation but it is intentional for balance).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Spell poise works with deflect mechanics. \"Tennis\" in Skyrim circa 4E 201.[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/HU8ClqW.gif[/img]\n<br />[b][color=#d9ead3][size=5]Stagger Whitelist:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Poisebreaker has a stagger whitelist for magic effects that should instantly cause a stagger. The whitelist allows for most stagger sources to be patched over to poise. To add an effect to whitelist, create a new ini (any name) in the Poisebreaker_EffectWhitelist folder and add your magic effect under [StaggerWhitelist] with the following template:[/size][b][size=2]\xa0\x45\x66\x66\x65\x63t = Modname.esp:0xFormID[/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[color=#999999][size=5][b]Configurability:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />All formulas can be changed in the ini,\xa0 but tamper at your own risk. Note that the logarithm formulas are very sensitive, you can end up with ridiculous values like 100% hyperarmor at LightArmor skilllevel 40.\n<br />\n<br />Poisebreaker also has global Poise damage and Poise Health modifiers.
